    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Amy Wilmot and I am currently working on my web development portfolio. So welcome!
    I am still in the early stages of my web development journey,but I am particularly passionate about creating user-friendly and good-looking websites that help non-profits share their stories, connect with supporters, 
    and run their programs smoothly. </p>
    <p>I believe that creating accessible and affordable websites for non-profits can do a lot of good.
    User-friendly websites will allow non-profits to reach more people,allow for more of an online presence and also make it easier for people to donate and volunteer.
    This collaboration brings the power of the internet to causes that aim to make the world a better place.</p>
